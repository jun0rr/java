/**
 * Implementations of this interface serve as resolvers for bridge methods. For the Java compiler, a method
 * signature does not include any information on a method's return type. However, within Java byte code, a
 * distinction is made such that the Java compiler needs to include bridge methods where the method with the more
 * specific return type is called from the method with the less specific return type when a method is
 * overridden to return a more specific value. This resolution is important when auxiliary types are called since
 * an accessor required for {@code Foo#qux} on some type {@code Bar} with an overriden method {@code qux} that was
 * defined with a more specific return type would call the bridge method internally and not the intended method.
 * This can be problematic if the following chain is the result of an instrumentation:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A {@code super} method accessor is registered for {@code Foo#qux} for some auxiliary type {@code Baz}.</li>
 * <li>The accessor is a bridging method which calls {@code Bar#qux} with the more specific return type.</li>
 * <li>The method {@code Bar#qux} is intercepted by an instrumentation.</li>
 * <li>Within the instrumented implementation, the auxiliary type {@code Baz} is used to invoke {@code Foo#qux}.</li>
 * <li>The {@code super} method invocation hits the bridge which delegates to the intercepted implementation what
 * results in endless recursion.</li>
 * </ol>
